Its been a while that the plugin has received major updates and bug fixes. My (free)time is limited and I have multiple projects to maintain. Once I've updated my background-mode plugin the local-notification plugin will get an official release supporting ios10. The ios10 branch will be merged into the master as well.\n\n2. For the future I am looking for other opportunities to support and enhance the plugin. That might be a crowdfunding campain or adding other core maintainers. Everyone with an serious interest is welcome to contact me!\n\n3. I am aware of the growing number of open issues and pull. Therefore, there's a new ticket template that can be found [here][ticket_template]. For every new issue please add an filled template. That will help rwillett and me to faster response to your issue. If you ignore this template, we'll ignore your issue.\n\n__UPDATE (22.05.2017)__ I've released v0.8.5 with contains the code from ios10 branch as it is. I will start working on a new major version while dropping support for older SDKs. I will try to include all you PRs.\n\nThanks for using my plugin and for your support!</br>\nSebastián Katzer\n\nCordova Local-Notification Plugin\n=================================\n\nThe essential purpose of local notifications is to enable an application to inform its users that it has something for them — for example, a message or an upcoming appointment — when the application isn’t running in the foreground.<br>\nThey are scheduled by an application and delivered on the same device.\n\n<img width=\"35%\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"19\" vspace=\"12\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications/example/images/android.png\"></img>\n\n### How they appear to the user\nUsers see notifications in the following ways:\n- Displaying an alert or banner\n- Badging the app’s icon\n- Playing a sound\n\n\n### Examples of Notification Usage\nLocal notifications are ideally suited for applications with time-based behaviors, such as calendar and to-do list applications. Applications that run in the background for the limited period allowed by iOS might also find local notifications useful.<br>\nFor example, applications that depend on servers for messages or data can poll their servers for incoming items while running in the background; if a message is ready to view or an update is ready to download, they can then present a local notification immediately to inform their users.\n\n\n## Supported Platforms\nThe current 0.8 branch supports the following platforms:\n- __iOS__ _(>= 8)_<br>\n- __Android__ _(SDK >=7)_\n- __Windows 8.1__ _(added with v0.8.2)_\n- __Windows Phone 8.1__ _(added with v0.8.2)_\n- __Windows 10__ _(added with v0.8.3)_\n\nFind out more information [here][wiki_platforms] in our wiki.\n\n\n## Installation\nThe plugin is installable from source and available on Cordova Plugin Registry and PhoneGap Build.\n\nFind out more information [here][wiki_installation] in our wiki.\n\n\n## I want to get a quick overview\nAll wiki pages contain samples, but for a quick overview, the sample section may be the fastest way.\n\nFind out more information [here][wiki_samples] in our wiki.\n\n\n## I want to get a deep overview\nThe plugin supports scheduling local notifications in various ways with a single interface. It also allows you to update, clear or cancel them. There are different interfaces to query for local notifications and a complete set of events to hook into the life cycle of local notifications.\n\nFind out more about how to schedule single, multiple, delayed or repeating local notifications [here][wiki_schedule].<br>\nInformation about events like _click_ or _trigger_ can be found [here][wiki_events].\n\nTo get a deep overview we recommend to read about all the topics in our [wiki][wiki] and try out the [Kitchen Sink App][wiki_kitchensink]\n\n\n## I want to see the plugin in action\nThe plugin offers a kitchen sink sample app. Check out the Cordova project and run the app directly from your command line or preferred IDE.\n\nFind out more information [here][wiki_kitchensink] in our wiki.\n\n\n## What's new\nWe are proud to announce our newest release version 0.8.x. Besides the hard work at the office and at the weekends it contains a lot of goodies, new features and easy to use APIs.\n\nFind out more information [here][wiki_changelog] in our wiki.\n\n\n## Sample\nThe sample demonstrates how to schedule a local notification which repeats every week. The listener will be called when the user has clicked on the local notification.\n\n```javascript\nvar date = new Date();\n\ncordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({\n    id: 1,\n    title: \"Message Title\",\n    message: \"Message Text\",\n    firstAt: date, // firstAt and at properties must be an IETF-compliant RFC 2822 timestamp\n    every: \"week\", // this also could be minutes i.e. 25 (int)\n    sound: \"file://sounds/reminder.mp3\",\n    icon: \"http://icons.com/?cal_id=1\",\n    data: { meetingId:\"123#fg8\" }\n});\n\ncordova.plugins.notification.local.on(\"click\", function (notification) {\n    joinMeeting(notification.data.meetingId);\n});\n```\n\nFind out more information [here][wiki_samples] in our wiki.\n\n\n## I would like to propose new features\nWe appreciate any feature proposal and support for their development. Please describe them [here][feature_proposal_issue].\n\nFind out more information [here][wiki_next] in our wiki.\n\n## Supporting\nYour support is needed.
